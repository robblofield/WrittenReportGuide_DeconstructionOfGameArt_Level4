Below is a planning and structure breakdown based on the essay question:

> Write a 1200 word assignment deconstructing examples of the artistic use of a chosen subject/technique (i.e lighting, texturing, sound design, animation etc) within your choice of indie game released in the last 10 years.

For this example report I have chosen the artistic use of colour between distinct areas of the environment in *Hades (2020)* by Supergiant Games as my subject.
